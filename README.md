UMAP projection for multiple plasmids

A UMAP scope for multiple plasmids clusters with a kmer-like algorithm. 
You can see the plasmids cluster in the map just like the cocci-strains under the microscope.

An interesting clustering depcition shows the potential both of this algorithm for the plasmid clustering and the UMAP for the visualization.
